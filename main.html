		<p>Basically, each flower consists of a floral axis upon which are 
			borne the essential organs of reproduction (stamens and pistils) and 
			usually accessory organs (sepals and petals); 
			the latter may serve to both attract pollinating 
			insects and protect the essential organs

		<p>The rose plant's fleshy, sometimes edible, 
			berrylike “fruit” (actually the floral cup) is

			from red to orange in colour
